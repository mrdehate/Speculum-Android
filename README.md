It's a fork of Speculum! I haven't done proper development in a long time, so I'm just hacking changes into the source willy-nilly.

Changes from the original by NielsMasdorp:

* Changed temperature forecast to be daily high rather than average of high and low
* Changed forecast to include day of week, not month
* Removed humidity, pressure, and visibility
* Removed Reddit headline
* Updated forecast.io to darksky.net API
